# MOS-Rust
Welcome to the MOS-Rust! This organization hosts the MOS-Rust project, an educational initiative aimed at porting the MOS operating system to Rust. This project serves as a learning platform for those interested in operating systems, Rust programming, and systems architecture.

## About MOS

MOS is an educational operating system initially developed in C for the MIPS processor architecture. It provides a simplified environment for students to understand the core components and functionalities of an operating system.

## Our Goal

The goal of the MOS-Rust project is to recreate the functionality of MOS in a completely Rust-based environment.
